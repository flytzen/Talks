# GDPR for software builders
The new General Data Protection Regulations are neearly upon us and if you haven't started preparing yet, now would be a good time to panic.

In this lightning talk, I will highlight the key areas that you need to consider in your software - even if you *think* you don't store personal data.

GDPR is the replacement for the Data Protection Act. The deadline for compliance is May 2018 and it arrives with much tighter rules and significantly increased fines. It has a an extended scope and tighter rules for consent, subject access requests, the right to be forgotten, automated deletion, auditing and more.
