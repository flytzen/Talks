# Talks
I have worked with Azure for years now and work closely with various teams in Microsoft to test, provide feedback and help improve the Azure offerings, in particular around security and compliance.

I like talking about Azure so I am available to do a number of talks at community events. 

## Current talks
- [GDPR for Software Builders](GDPR_for_software_builders.md)  
(more talks on GDPR aimed at other audiences coming soon)
- [SQL Azure - the intelligent cloud database](SQL_Azure_the_intelligent_cloud_database.md)
- [Securing web apps in azure](Securing_web_apps_in_azure.md)
